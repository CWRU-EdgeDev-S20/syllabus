# EECS 397: Designing IoT Edge Devices

## Course Description


A hands-on, design experience building _Internet of Things_ (**IoT**) Edge Devices. The course introduces the tools and concepts needed to build and deploy a customized edge device, including an Embedded Linux system from scratch running on an Intel x86 development board with an Intel FPGA.  Interfacing to sensors and networking hardware are covered, including low-level Linux configuration and device drivers.  Network connectivity and integration for edge devices are explored (e.g., protocols like MQTT), as well as SSH and HTML/CSS. Custom user interface design (Qt) and real-time video processing are presented as sample applications of edge devices.  Hands-on lab projects allow students to gain practical hardware and software debugging experience. Students have an opportunity to develop their own project, based on the core design examples.

Recommended preparation: C, Python, and Verilog programming experience. Prereq: EECS 281 and EECS 233.  


## Course Overview


### Text Book

A textbook for the course will not be required. 

Lab assignment guides include necessary documentation to complete the project designs and provide supplemental reading links to the ***[Safari Books Online](https://learning.oreilly.com/home/)*** service, which is provided free for all CWRU students ([KSL Link](https://safarijv.auth0.com/authorize?client_id=UtNi1m1IRXgzYFIwZrhSxell9EDRaL2v&response_type=code&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Flearning.oreilly.com%2Fcomplete%2Fauth0%2Doauth2%2F&state=/home/&connection=case-western-reserve-university)). 


### Course Structure

The course will be primarily laboratory focused, with 9 project assignments in total.  The first 5 assignments will be one week assignments, covering basic topics.  The next 3 assignments will be two week assignments, which build off the basic assignments to create more complicated designs.  The final three week project will allow students to create their own design using what has been learned in the previous labs.

The course will **not** include a final exam.

### Course Ethics and Policies

* _All work turned in should be that of your own._
* Study groups are encouraged, but, again,
* _All work turned in should be your own._
* Neither copy another student's work nor allow your work to be copied.
* Please refer to the [University's Academic Integrity Standards](http://www.case.edu/provost/ugstudies/acintegrity.htm)
* Ultimately cheating only hurts yourself - short term success may seem appealing to meet a deadline, but in the long term not learning the material will come back to bite you in ways you can't anticipate.   Punishments for engaging in this kind of activity are VERY severe and non-reversible.  So simply don't go there.
